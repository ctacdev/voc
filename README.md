# VOC Marketing Site

## Running the Site
Make sure you have ruby installed (preferably with RVM!)
### Check it out:
git clone git@bitbucket.org:jraines/comment_tool_site.git

### Install Jekyll:
gem install 'jekyll' OR bundle install

### Run the site:
jekyll serve --watch

### Browse:
http://localhost:4000


TODO:
* Focus on content for now, Styling should stick to a CSS Framework, Hardcoding styles makes it MUCH harder to add content
* We should add slideshare style slides and other marketing materials
* Write up the roadmap.
* Make sure HHS wants to be the "authoritative repo", otherwise we create our own
* We should do future work in the "authoritative repo"
* Write up all technical information from docs into site documentation
* Make this site, itself, available on github, so that anyone can update docs (with prose.io even)
